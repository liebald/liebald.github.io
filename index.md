I'm currently a co-founder at Mensch Labs, an early-stage technology startup.

Before founding Mensch Labs, I was a Senior Staff Software Engineer and Engineering Manager at Google, where I led YouTube's Personalization, Recommendations, and Homepage efforts. We built experiences that delighted hundreds of millions of users. I also had the honor of receiving a Technology Emmy Award on behalf of YouTube for the development of YouTube's personalized video recommendation engine in 2014. Before YouTube, I led various projects and teams in personalization, search ranking, and spam detection at Google.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from Jacobs University Bremen. At Jacobs, I was a member of the university's "Pioneer's Class" of 2004 and the recipient of numerous honors and awards for outstanding academic achievements. I was the first alumnus to join the Board of Jacobs University Foundation of America in 2010.

I'm an expert in large-scale, distributed, and real-time personalization, recommendations, and machine learning systems, and have a strong background and keen interest in product design, team leadership, and engineering management, and have been advising a number of early and later-stage startups in those areas.
